## Work in Progress: A Personal Starter Kit

This is a personal starter kit with packages I frequently use and configuration settings I prefer not to recreate every time.

### Will Consist Of

- Proper folder structure. I prefer `core/` instead of `lib` and floating that. Thus it will be:

â”œâ”€â”€ core
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config          # config files with data such as menu items to map over, or other configuration files. See how site.ts is used in layout.tsx in the root(!)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ menu.ts
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ site.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ database
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ firebase
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ firebase.ts
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ graphql
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ apollo-client.ts
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ apollo-wrapper.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hooks
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ use-click-outside.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib            # utility functions. ShadN standard is @/lib/utils so if you partly migrate over to this structure be sure to find and replace `@/lib/utils` with `@/core/lib/utils` and change the path in `components.json`
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ animations
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ nav-animations.ts
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ bezier-curves.ts
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ clsx.ts
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ node-module-patches # When you need to make patches to the core I prefer uppercase
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ next-link.ts   # underscore to indicate it's a patch
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ actions    # fetch logic goes here. Inline in components is fine for small projects but will get messy fast
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ queries    # fetch logic goes here. Inline in components is fine for small projects but will get messy fast
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ fetch-anything.ts
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mutations
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ mutate-deez-nuts.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ types
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ types.ts
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ...extend

## components

â”œâ”€â”€ auth
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sign-in
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sign-in.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sign-up
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ sign-up.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ kanban
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components  # specific component folder inside feature if unique to feature only

â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ marketing  # pages should go here that provide information about the product/service. Landing page, contact, about etc
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ about
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ page.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ contact
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ page.tsx
â””â”€â”€ page.tsx

## Included Packages

The following packages are included in this project. Packages marked with an asterisk (*) are considered essential.
- Styling
    <small>Remember, Tailwind is a utils framework so there's no shame in combining plain css/sass/less (well less you should be ashamed) for more complex pseudo and animation work</small>
  - Tailwind CSS* for most boilerplate styling.
  - SCSS for more complex styling.
- Next-themes: Used for implementing dark/light mode.

## Theme
  - Radix UI*: This serves as the base for Shadcn-ui components.
  - Next-themes: Used for implementing dark/light mode.
    ```tsx
    allows to use <div className='bg-back dark:bg-white'>
```

## Random libs
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)*: Used for form handling.
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/): Used for animations. SCSS works fine, but anim in JS can get a bit more advanced. Worth the learning curve.
- [Million.js -ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥Blazingly fast javascriptðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥Blazingly fast javascriptðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ ](https://million.dev/):
New kid on the block. It says it compiles my stuff about treefiddy times faster so I believe it. Refer to next-config.-
- [NextTopLoader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nextjs-toploader): Adds a fancy loading bar at the top of the page with a lot of customization options. Default is off but can be turned on in layout.tsx with a **TODO DON'T FORGET!!!@remcostoeten**

## Misc libs
- [clsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx): Used for conditional classnames.
- [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/): Used for icons.
- [Tailwind merge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwindcss-merge): Used for merging Tailwind classes.


## data(base)
    <small>Firebase rocks for quick prototyping and hobby projects. Got almost everything you need. No ORM or other stupid configs</small>
- Firebase: Used for authentication and Firestore database. Setup [here](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and fill the `.env.local` <Small>(And let's be honest, Clerk auth is not the most visually appealing)<small>
- [Firebase - react hookforms](https://github.com/CSFrequency/react-firebase-hooks/tree/09bf06b28c82b4c3c1beabb1b32a8007232ed045): Used for form handling.
    <small>For separate back-ends I Setup an optional Apollo GraphQL </small>

- [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/): Used for handling GraphQL.

<small>Another BaaS but with a more traditional squeal/postgres feel</small>
- Convex: A more robust database solution.
- Clerk: An alternative for those who prefer not to use Firebase for authentication.

## Additional Packages
- class-variance-authority: Additional package for class variance authority.
- @vercel/speed-insights: Vercel package for speed insights. <small>Obviously only works when deployed to vercel. Remove from Providers.tsx if not needed</small>
- @vercel/analytics: Vercel package for analytics. <small>Obviously only works when deployed to vercel. Remove from Providers.tsx if not needed</small>
- builder.io/react-hydration-overlay: Builder.io is based. It makes you want to jump a little less often from a bridge when having hydration errors. <small>Remove from Providers.tsx if not needed</small>
- Sharp. Idk vercel keeps telling me to use it. It should optimize images, or is a Bitcoin miner, who knows.

## DX
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/): Used for code formatting.
   See `prettier.config.js` for configuration. Don't feel free to change it. It's perfect.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/): Used for linting.
    See `.eslintrc.js` for configuration. Don't feel free to change it. It's perfect.
